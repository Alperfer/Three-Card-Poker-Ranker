# Three-Hand-Poker-Ranker
A 3 hand poker round generator and ranker. This is a command line based program that simulates rounds of a 3 card poker game. Each round is assumed to be played with 4 players on the table. Program generates three random cards for each player, and then ranks the hands of the players based on their card strength. The winner of each round is announced at the end.

# Planned Improvements/Features
1- Planning to add a chip system, where each round will affect the random amount of chips a player has bet on a round. Players would be able to bust, the game would continue with the remaning players until there is a winner.<br>
2- GUI interface.
